# Morph-Analyser
Here this Morph Analyser is the basic source for the Magahi morph analyser for the Magahi reginal language for the the general purpose in NLP applications.
With the help of computational linguistics concepts and reference from the apertium and lttoolbox .

apertium :- Apertium is a rule-based machine translation toolchain and ecosystem, with many of our tools based on finite-state transducers

Lttoolbox :- lttoolbox is a toolbox for lexical processing, morphological analysis and generation of words. Analysis is the process of splitting a word (e.g. cats)        into its lemma 'cat' and the grammatical information <n><pl>. Generation is the opposite process. lttoolbox contains finite state tools for lexical processing,      morphological analysis and generation of words. Analysis is the process of splitting a word like cats into its lemma cat and the grammatical information <n><pl>. Generation is the opposite process.

-> There is a deep documentation in the lttoolbox which helps how to create dictionary and dix file for the morph analyser, how to run morph analyser and for that it also have commands to run the code and brief explaination for that.

-> so basically apertium is the base for any morph analyser or a morph generator and Lttoolbox is the guidence for the morph analysser and morph generator .
